# Instead of trying every permutation (O(N!) complexity), we use DFS with backtracking to efficiently explore possible dungeon sequences without generating all permutations explicitly.

# DFS is useful because:

# We try each dungeon in any order without pre-sorting or pre-generating permutations.
# We backtrack if a dungeon cannot be explored, preventing unnecessary searches.
# We track visited dungeons to avoid revisiting the same one in a sequence.


#üîπ DFS avoids generating all permutations explicitly, making it faster than brute-force permutations.
#üîπ Still runs efficiently for N ‚â§ 8 but better scales for N ‚âà 1000.

# Why This is Faster than Brute-Force Permutations?
# Approach	Time Complexity	Explanation
# Brute-force (Permutations)	O(N!)	Tries every order explicitly
# DFS with Backtracking	O(N √ó 2^N)	Only explores valid dungeon orders
# Why O(N √ó 2^N)?
# For each dungeon, we either explore it or skip it (binary choice).
# There are 2^N possible dungeon exploration paths.
# Each path takes O(N) operations (since we iterate over dungeons).
# For N = 8, brute-force O(8!) = 40,320, while DFS runs in ~256 steps (O(8 √ó 2‚Å∏)), a massive improvement!

#summary
# DFS with Backtracking avoids unnecessary computations.
# Much faster than brute-force permutations (O(N √ó 2^N) vs O(N!)).
# Efficient for N ‚â§ 1000 dungeons.
# Finds the maximum dungeons explored in optimal order.
